# Import Fix Instructions

## Issue Fixed âœ…

The error you encountered was due to missing Gemini client imports that were removed during the migration. I've fixed all the import issues:

### Files Fixed:
1. **`src/voice_assistant/__init__.py`** - Updated to import OpenAI client instead of Gemini
2. **`src/voice_assistant/core/multilingual_assistant.py`** - Updated imports and error messages
3. **`src/voice_assistant/telephony/ari_handler.py`** - Updated to use OpenAI client

## Missing Dependencies

The remaining issue is that you need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Install the missing websockets dependency
pip install websockets>=10.0,<13.0

# Or install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Test

After installing dependencies, test the import:

```bash
python3 -c "from src.voice_assistant import VoiceAssistant; print('âœ… Import successful')"
```

## Start the Server

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the server:

```bash
python src/run_realtime_server.py
```

## Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file has the OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Copy the example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

## Summary

The migration is complete! The only remaining step is installing the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then your OpenAI-powered voice assistant will be ready to run! ðŸš€
