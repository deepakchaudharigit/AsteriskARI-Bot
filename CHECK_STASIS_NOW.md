# 🎉 SUCCESS! WebSocket Connected

## ✅ What Just Happened

The WebSocket connection to ARI was **successful**:
- ✅ Connected to `ws://localhost:8088/ari/events?app=openai-voice-assistant`
- ✅ No connection errors
- ✅ Stasis application should now be registered

## 🔍 IMMEDIATE CHECK REQUIRED

**Run this command to verify Stasis registration:**

```bash
sudo asterisk -rx 'ari show apps'
```

**Expected result:**
```
Application Name         
=========================
openai-voice-assistant
```

## 📞 TEST YOUR VOICE ASSISTANT

If the Stasis app is registered:

1. **Dial 1000 in Zoiper**
2. **Expected flow:**
   - ✅ Call connects
   - ✅ Welcome message plays
   - ✅ **Transfers to AI** (no disconnection!)
   - ✅ **Voice conversation begins**

## 🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ **No disconnection** after welcome message
- ✅ **AI responds** to your voice
- ✅ **Natural conversation** flows

## 🚀 IF IT WORKS

**Congratulations!** You now have:
- **Real-time AI voice assistant** ✅
- **Asterisk PBX integration** ✅
- **OpenAI GPT-4 conversations** ✅
- **NPCL customer service** ✅

## 🔧 IF STASIS APP NOT REGISTERED

If `ari show apps` is still empty:

1. **Keep WebSocket connection alive:**
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python3 working_websocket_client.py
   ```

2. **In another terminal, check registration:**
   ```bash
   sudo asterisk -rx 'ari show apps'
   ```

3. **Test with call while WebSocket is connected**

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Check Stasis registration** (command above)
2. **Test voice assistant** (dial 1000)
3. **Celebrate success!** 🎉

**The WebSocket connection worked - your voice assistant should now be functional!** 🚀
