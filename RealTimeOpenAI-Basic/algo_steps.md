Top 10 Chat App Feature Categories
Real-time Communication: The core function of any chat app. This includes instant messaging, read receipts, typing indicators, and the ability to share rich media like photos, videos, and documents.

End-to-End Encryption: A fundamental security feature that ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message. This prevents third parties, including the app provider, from accessing the content.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): For group chats and business applications, this allows administrators to define permissions for different user roles (e.g., admin, moderator, member), controlling who can post, delete messages, or add new users.

Multi-Platform Support: The ability to seamlessly switch between devices (e.g., mobile, desktop, web) while maintaining conversation history and session state. This is essential for a fluid user experience.

Voice and Video Calls: High-quality, real-time voice and video communication, often with features like screen sharing, virtual backgrounds, and call recording.

Advanced Search and Filters: The ability to quickly find old messages or files using keywords, dates, or sender names. This is crucial for navigating long chat histories.

Customization and Personalization: Features that allow users to change their app's theme, notification sounds, chat backgrounds, and emoji sets. This makes the app feel more personal and engaging.

Integrations and Bots: The ability to connect the chat app with other services (e.g., Google Calendar, Trello, GitHub) or use bots for automation, scheduling, and information retrieval.

Message Reactions and Threading: Tools for managing conversation flow in busy group chats. Reactions provide a quick way to respond without a new message, while threading organizes replies under a specific message.

Rich Presence: Status indicators that show a user's availability (e.g., online, offline, busy), current activity (e.g., "In a meeting"), or mood. This provides context to conversations.

Repository Guidelines
The repository guidelines you've outlined provide a good structure for a well-maintained project. To write a detailed algorithm, we can take a closer look at a specific feature, like the Real-time Bidirectional Communication that your voice_chatbot.py uses.

Detailed Algorithm: Real-time Bidirectional Communication
Here is a step-by-step algorithm that explains how your chatbot handles a single turn of conversation, from user input to AI response.

Phase 1: User Input and Streaming
Start Audio Capture: The system initializes PyAudio to open the microphone's input stream.

Listen for Voice Activity: A loop continuously reads small chunks of audio data from the microphone.

Detect Start of Speech: The system uses a voice activity detection (VAD) mechanism (either a built-in library or a simple threshold check) to identify when a user starts speaking.

Connect to AI: Upon detecting speech, the system establishes a WebSocket connection to the OpenAI Realtime API.

Stream Audio: The system begins streaming the captured audio chunks to the WebSocket connection. The audio is typically converted to a base64-encoded string before sending.

Detect End of Speech: The system continues streaming until it detects a pause of a predefined duration (e.g., 500ms), signaling the end of the user's turn.

Phase 2: AI Processing and Response
AI Transcription: The OpenAI API receives the audio stream, transcribes it into text, and processes it with the language model.

Generate Response: The AI generates a text response based on the user's input and the conversation's context.

Stream Audio Response: The AI's text response is converted back into an audio stream by a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The system begins streaming this audio back to the client via the same WebSocket connection.

Process Interruption: If the user speaks again while the AI is responding, the system's VAD detects it. The WebSocket connection is immediately interrupted and a new conversation turn is initiated, starting from Phase 1.

Phase 3: Client-side Output and Cleanup
Play Audio Stream: The client-side application receives the AI's audio stream, decodes the base64 data, and plays it back through the speakers.

Display Dialogue (Optional): The transcribed text and the AI's response text are displayed in the terminal for the user.

End Conversation Turn: Once the AI's audio response is complete, the system's loop returns to a listening state, waiting for the user's next input to begin the process again.
